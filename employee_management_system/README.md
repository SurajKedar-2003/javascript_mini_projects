# Employee Management System

## Overview
The Employee Management System is a web-based application that allows users to manage employee data efficiently. Users can add, update, delete, and view employee details in a table format. The application leverages JavaScript for DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence through local storage, ensuring that data remains consistent across sessions.

## Features

- **Add Employee**: Users can input employee details such as name, email, mobile number, date of birth, password, and profile picture. This information is stored in local storage and displayed in the employee table.

- **Update Employee**: Existing employee records can be updated. Users can edit any employeeâ€™s details, and the changes are immediately reflected in the table and saved to local storage.

- **Delete Employee**: Employees can be removed from the system. Deleting an employee removes their record from both the table and local storage.

- **View Employee Data**: The application automatically loads and displays employee data from local storage when the page is loaded, ensuring that previously entered data is readily available.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For adding functionality, handling user interactions, manipulating the DOM, and managing local storage.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **DOM Manipulation**: Effectively managing and updating the DOM to reflect changes in the employee data.
- **Event Handling**: Capturing and responding to user actions such as form submissions, button clicks, and file uploads.
- **Local Storage Management**: Storing and retrieving employee data to ensure persistence across sessions.
